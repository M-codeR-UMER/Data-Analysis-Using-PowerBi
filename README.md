# 📊 Sales Dashboard - Power BI Project

This project features an interactive and dynamic **Sales Dashboard** built using **Power BI**. The underlying data was sourced from a MySQL database, queried using **MySQL Workbench**, and then modeled, cleaned, and visualized in Power BI using DAX measures and calculated columns.

## 📁 Dataset

The data was imported from a structured **MySQL database** (see `db_dump.sql`). It includes information related to:

- Sales transactions
- Products and categories
- Customer details
- Dates and order timelines

---

## 📚 Data Source

This project's data was sourced from the [Sales Insights Project](https://codebasics.io/resources/sales-insights-data-analysis-project) by [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/).  
The original database dump (`db_dump.sql`) is publicly available for educational and non-commercial use.
